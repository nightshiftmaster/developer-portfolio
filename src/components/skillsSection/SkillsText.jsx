        My stack — React, TypeScript, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB — transforms
        ideas into interactive, accessible interfaces. With a focus on component
        architecture, state management, and performance, I write clean, testable
        code, integrating CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments.
        From frontend polish to backend APIs, I build reliable solutions that
        balance functionality, performance, and user experience.
